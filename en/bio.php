            <p>With more than ten years in the scene <span>Rotten Pork</span>  has become a <span>Death Metal</span>  standard in the Puerto Vallarta and BahÃ­a de Banderas area.</p>

            <p>This rotten pork <span>started to cook in 2009</span>, by  David Valenciana (Guitar/Drums) and Javier Ponce (Bass); creators of this project that has been evolving throughout the years.</p> 
                
            <p>With a demo and a single they started this journey at<span> local gigs in Puerto Vallarta</span>, which is when Ulises joined the band. A talented singer that grew up on quality growls and pig squeals.</p>

            <p>In the year 2012 the first EP arrived, displaying a solid direction for the band. <span>"PÃºtrida Insanidad"</span> has 7 sick songs, in which you can hear a real <span>Grindcore and Slamming </span> influence.</p>    
            
            <p>In the same year Sacha Desautels joined the band. Being a talented musician, drummer and performer; he brought energy they needed because of the aggressive way he plays on the stage.</p> 
                
            <p>Until this day the band holds a <span>stable line-up </span> with Axlâ€™s arrival as a guitar player in the year 2014.</p>

            <p>The execution and composition of the band has been getting more mature, and the result of that is  <span>"Tales Of Failure"</span>,  the first full length of the band. It has 13 songs that show an array of technical and blackened riffs without letting brutality go.</p>
                
             <p>Theres no doubt that <span>Rotten Pork</span> has earned the unconditional support of the Vallarta music scene. Due to that support, they have traveled to other states to perform.</p>
                
            <p>The band has shared the stage with bands like <span>Equipoise</span>, <span>Faceless</span>, <span>Origin</span>, <span>Putrid Pile</span>, <span>Unidad Trauma</span>, <span>Carnal Diafragma</span>, <span>Dios Perro</span>, <span>Medical Negligence</span>, <span>Frank Metal Mascara</span>, entre otras.</p>
